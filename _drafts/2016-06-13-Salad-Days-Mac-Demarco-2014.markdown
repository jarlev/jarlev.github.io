Here's an ode to my favorite Canadian... it's not Justin Bieber.

Mac Demarco. I love that gap-toothed, goofy ass, songwriter extraordinaire. 
He's an absolute treat to see live.

One of the reasons I really like Mac is that he's just a genuinely weird, crazy dude but he's also supposedly a really nice guy who loves making music. He lives for it. And he's been very humbled by the fame he's garnered over the past few years.

He doesn't make music to be famous or to make money; he does it for his extreme love for it.
Mac plays music. The success is just a benefit, plus it helps that he's talented is fuck and works his ass off in the studio.

1.	"Salad Days"
2.	"Blue Boy"
3.	"Brother"

"Shit...."
I love this song. It starts of with this beautiful, bluesy guitar riff. I wish I knew more about guitar tuning so I could better describe its unique sound in "Brother". Mac does an excellent job with the bass in this song, which I think really provides an excellent foundation but also takes the lead and allows the guitar to jam and fill in the gaps.

As the song progresses 

Towards the end, the song transitions towards a more psychadelic feel. The reverb is turned up.


4.	"Let Her Go"
5.	"Goodbye Weekend"

I read about this song before.

"Don't go telling me how this boy should believe in his own life."



"If you don't agree with the things that go on within my life, well honey that's fine, just know that you're wasting your time."

Mac makes it pretty clear that you don't have to love or understand everything that he does with his life. He's a weird dude, he knows it. And he doesn't care what the music magazines say about him or what they put in their reviews. He's staying true to himself and making the music that he's passionate about.

7.	"Passing Out Pieces"
